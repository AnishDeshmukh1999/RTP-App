# RTP/RTCP MP3 Streaming Application

This is an RTP/RTCP Server/Client Application to stream MP3 audio via Real Time Protocol (RTP) and Real Time Control Protocol (RTCP). The application framework is based on the Cherno's Walnut template: [https://github.com/StudioCherno/WalnutAppTemplate](https://github.com/StudioCherno/WalnutAppTemplate). The template has been modified to resemble a simple media player like windows Media player. The Application uses Boost's asio library for sending RTP packets over UDP, Steam's Gamenetworking Sockets [https://github.com/ValveSoftware/GameNetworkingSockets](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/GameNetworkingSockets) for TCP, protobuf for sending control information (ex. Song info, Play/Stop commands, ID3v2 Tags, Song duration etc), the Vulkan API to display images (Album art), the header-only MiniMP3 library to decode MP3 frames [https://github.com/lieff/minimp3 ](https://github.com/lieff/minimp3) and SDL to play the decoded audio.
